# Please download the three text files a.txt, b.txt, and c.txt from the resources and place them in your computer IDE.
# Then, create a program that:
# 1. reads each text file and
# 2. prints out the content of each file in the command line.
# The expected output would be like the following:

# filenames=["a.txt","b.txt","c.txt"]
#
# for filename in filenames:
#     file=open(f"files/{filename}","r")
#     content=file.read()
#     print(content)
